  <h1 class="blue-background">Dear Jayden</h1>
<p> <strong>Introduction:</strong> I miss you. I created this webpage as a tribute to you. I hope you are doing well.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>About Us:</strong> We met in May 2020. It was near the beginning of quarantine. We spent our days facetiming and texting, and waiting for the time to come when we could actually be together. We joked around and talked about our friends and families. We made plans and longed for the day we could be together; walking around campus hand in hand. We fantasized and romanticized. We even thought of dressing up as a couple for Halloween. When that day finally came I picked you up at the airport and our first date was breakfast at Buddy's Diner. You were nervous and shy. But eventually you and I became best friends. I wanted you to meet my family, and my pets. That one day I wish I took you to the beach, I'm sorry I didn't. Then you left. I regret ever breaking ties with you after that. If I would have known how hard it would be without you I never would have done it.</p>

  <p> <strong>Mission Statement:</strong> I never would have gone through all this effort if I didn't think we were meant to be together for a very long time. Give us a chance.</p>
  <hr>
  <p><Strong> Conclusion: </strong>I guess if at the end of all of that you still don't want to take a chance on us, I got a little bit of experience coding, and you have this webpage. Papa Bless. (I still don't know what it means).</p>
